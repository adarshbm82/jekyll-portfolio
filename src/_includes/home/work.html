        <h1>Robin Rooms</h1>
        <h2>Room schedules, right at your door</h2>
        <p>
          I build the iPad and Android tablet applications. Customers mount these tablets outside of their conference rooms as interactive digital signage indicating the current status and daily schedule for the room.

        <h1>Robin Dashboard</h1>
        <h2>An overview and management portal for the spaces in your office</h2>
        <p>
          I build the Angular web application that customers use to manage their Robin powered offices. This ranages from a dashboard to browse the activity in the office to a management portal for managing spaces, calendars, and other resources.

        <p>
          Tweetdrive was a trivia game hosted on NBCSports.com during the 2011 NFL playoffs. I built the web application that allows users to engage in the game through either twitter or the web application itself.
